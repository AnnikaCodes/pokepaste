PokePaste

Pokepaste is a simple pastebin, with a clean interface, that supports
highlighting of the syntax created by Pokemon Showdown. This syntax has
become a standard, and is supported by multiple tools, yet no pastebin
(up until now) has had support for syntax-highlighting it.

PokePaste highlights mon names with their primary type, moves with their
type, items (where appropriate) with their associated type and more. It
also features an image preview for mons and items using art from the
Pokemon Global Link. The site is simple, standards-compliant and mobile-
friendly.

You can use PokePaste at <http://pokepast.es>.

Running PokePaste only needs Python 3+, plus SQlite (normally included)
and PyCrypto. You can use tools/schema.sql to initialise pokepaste.db,
and tools/fetch-images.py to fetch images from Pokemon Global Link (or
provide your own). Running pokepaste.py directly will start up a server
on port 8000 that's fine for development purposes.

If you plan on putting this on anything resembling the public Internet,
running behind a reverse proxy such as nginx is recommended. Is supports
WSGI, including uwsgi and Apache's mod_wsgi.
