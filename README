PokePaste

Pokepaste is a simple pastebin, with a clean interface, that supports
highlighting of the syntax created by Pokemon Showdown. This syntax has
become a standard, and is supported by multiple tools, yet no pastebin
(up until now) has had support for syntax-highlighting it.

PokePaste highlights mon names with their primary type, moves with their
type, items (where appropriate) with their associated type and more. It
also features an image preview for mons and items using art from the
Pokemon Global Link. The site is simple, standards-compliant and mobile-
friendly.

PokePaste v2 is written in Python, and depends on the Flask web
framework (for routing, templating, all the stuff PokePaste v1 used to
do manually), the cryptography library (for, you know, cryptography),
and the MySQL Connector/Python (for database access). The database
schema is pretty simple, you should be able to figure it out by looking
at the code, but I will add a SQL file to document it once this version
goes live. You can run the app using `flask run', after setting
FLASK_APP and FLASK_DEBUG appropriately.

If you plan on putting this on anything resembling the public Internet,
running behind a reverse proxy such as nginx, or using a WSGI server of
some kind (like uwsgi or mod_wsgi).
